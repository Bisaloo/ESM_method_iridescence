Description of the columns in review_iridescence.csv:

- Class: taxonomic class of the organisms in the study
- Taxon: smaller common monophyletic group including all species from the study
- Angles $(\Phi_{inc},\Phi_{col})$: angles used to quantify colour in the study. The angles are measured relative to the normal to the sample surface, as defined in the manuscript. See also the manuscript for the sign conventions. Sometimes, the angles were not reported in an unequivocal way and are therefore marked as "unknown". Newlines within a cell often represent a different measurement line. The list of angles is sometimes written in a compact form using classical set notation ({} for an exhaustive list or [start;end;step]) when it greatly improved readability.
- Angles $(\theta_i,\theta_r)$: angles used to quantify colour in the study. The angles are measured relative to the normal to the multilayer or thin-film sturcture, as defined in the manuscript. See also the manuscript for sign convention
- Hue: variable(s) used to describe hue. The variables in this column are named according to Montgomerie 2016 "Analyzing colors".
- Brightness: variable(s) used to describe brightness. The variables in this column are named according to Montgomerie 2016 "Analyzing colors".
- Saturation: variable(s) used to describe saturation. The variables in this column are named according to Montgomerie 2016 "Analyzing colors".
- Variables: other variables used to describe colour, including non-convetional indices or indices derived from vision models
- Vision_model: does the study use a vision model? If so, which one?
- Hue_shift: do the authors define a variable to quantify hue shift?
- Brightness_shift: do the authors define a variable to quantify brightness shift?
- Saturation_shift: do the authors define a varaible to quantify saturation shift?
- Plot: do the authors represent spectra (or characteristics of the spectra, such as hue or brightness) in a single plot, in so demonstrating an interest of the angle dependency of the colour
- Reference: citation key of the study, as defined in the attached bibteX file Iridescence.bib. This file can be imported in most bibliography managers, including but not limited to Zotero, Jabref or Mendeley.
